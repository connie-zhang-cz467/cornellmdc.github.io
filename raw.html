                    we are sharing our work with you. Composed largely of artistic contributions from our
                    Editorial and Experience team along with other members of MDC, this pavilion catalogues
                    our club’s work throughout the year. Let this pavilion be a reminder that no matter what
                    happens, creativity persists. Now, join us as we reminisce…”
                </p>
                <p>To celebrate Medium Design Collective’s RAW launch, we designed a Covid-safe pavilion in
                    the Arts Quad on the Cornell University Campus that at once acts as a way to share our
                    work and creativity with others in reality and as a commentary on the drab and lifeless
                    plastic Covid-testing tennis. The pavilion is a timber construction with an interior
                    transparent plastic mural decorated with our projects from the year, exhibited May 03
                    through May 10, 2021. It includes signs and stepping markers to observe Covid distancing
                    restrictions and does not pose a health or safety risk to the student body, rather it
                    serves as a reminder that creativity can overcome the challenges of life and bring a
                    positive energy to the community.
