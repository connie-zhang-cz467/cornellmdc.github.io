                    <p>Medium was founded in 2015 by 3 AAP students who decided to transform a design publication into a live event.
                        Together, they created RAW EXPO, a design exhibition in which students from all across campus showcased their work.
                        The evnet was a huge hit - 500+ attendees proved that there was an incredible amount of interest and need for an interdisciplinary design group.
                        From RAW, Medium Design Collective spawned, to become a community of designers who collaborate on innovative projects
                        and serve as a platform and resource for design dialogue.</p>
