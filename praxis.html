            Praxis partners with companies and student organizations to create, elevate, and 
            actualize brand identities. It is perfect for exploring the intersection of art, 
            design, and business. You'll have the opportunity to work in a variety of 
            disciplines, including graphic, UI, UX, product, and interior design. This 
            semester, there will be two projects with startup companies and one internal 
            initiative. You'll be working with Adam, the team lead, as well as one of 
            three project managers: Jenny, Hope, or Sia.
