                <p>Even with an extraordinarily limited scope, we might well perceive that the early 21st century is a
                    time of unprecedented transformation, an era that bears witness to tectonic cultural shifts,
                    extraordinary technological inno-vations, and revolutionary social movements. As designers creating
                    in these remarkable times, we have a particular responsibility -- to create, reimagine, and record
                    the milieu of our time.</p>
                <p>This semester, we have elected to essay one particular aspect of our collective experience-- digital
                    coexistence. More specifically, we will endeavour to explore the thousand and one ways in which we
                    coexist with technology, and how it continues to affect every facet of our lives. In addi-tion, we
                    hope to understand the ethical and philosophical implicature of this way of living, particularly as
                    it relates to creative endeavours. After-all, what is a painting when it's in pixels? What is value
                    when anything and everything can be replicated? What is authenticity when we can change the very
                    fundamentals of who we are?</p>
                <p>As you move through our creative efforts for this semester, we invite you to consider some of the
                    questions posed above. Join us at our gallery open-ing celebrating the culmination of projects
                    created by the Medium Design Collective this semester, also featuring Thread, Cornell Fashion
                    Collective, Cornell AppDev, and Maven.</p>
